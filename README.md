# Gradient Descent Implementation
__________________________________________

This project implements a logistic regression classifier with gradient descent algorithm for machine learning, as a part of 
**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** course at **KAU**. The goal is to train the model to classify provided data
as "0" or "1" (doesn't have heart disease or has heart disease).
